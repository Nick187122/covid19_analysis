# COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, focusing on:
- Case and death trends over time
- Country comparisons
- Vaccination progress
- Geographical patterns

## Objectives
1. Import and clean COVID-19 global data
2. Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
3. Compare metrics across countries/regions
4. Visualize trends with charts and maps
5. Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas (data manipulation)
- matplotlib/seaborn (visualization)
- plotly (interactive maps)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
3. Open and run `covid19_analysis.ipynb`

## Key Findings
1. Wealthier nations generally had higher vaccination rates
2. Case fatality rates varied significantly between countries
3. Countries experienced COVID waves at different times
4. Vaccination rollouts followed different trajectories
